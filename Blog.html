<td>Chocolate Chip Tricks<br>
    When I bake my Choclate Chip cookies I like to do a couple things different than the recipe calls for. One, I like to add a little more vanilla to make    it a little bit sweeter. Second I put less choclate chips in so that they are extra doughy. By doing these two things I have found that the cookie dough is tastier to eat and the cookies are fluffier and a tad sweeter. Also, after you are getting done mixing the batter put it into the fridge for about 5    minutes to let the dough get a little firmer.</td> <br>

<td>Rolls 12/06/2020<br>
    Tip of the day: When making rolls, put a small bowl of water inside the oven with the bread dough. By doing this it helps keep the crust soft and get that golden brown look that all bakers long for.</td><br>

<td>Pecan Pie Brownies 12/08/2020<br>
    When making your filling for the pecan pie brownies put half a cup less into the mixture to make them a little more chewy and gooey.</td>
